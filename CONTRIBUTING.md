# CONTRIBUTING

I am open to contributions!
If you want to add a new command or clean up my syntax, then by all means go ahead.
I would apreciate any help or additions by anyone as long as the following rules are followed:

  * Do not remove my name from the code.
  * Do not change any licensing information.
  * Make sure to add your name to the AUTHORS.md and the README.md

As far as formatting goes, follow these general guidelines:

  * Comments try to be inline and organized as columns
  * Comments will start with "// " before the actual comment.
  * Keep them brief!
